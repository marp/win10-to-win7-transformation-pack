# The image is specified with an image line.
# Multiple image lines may be present, in which case one will be picked by random.
# The image line may contain the following parts:
# Any of the following:
#  - "n=(number)", a weight for this image in the randomization process. Default: n=1.
#  - "x=(number)" or "x=keep", the x offset from the center. Default: x=0.
#  - "y=(number)" or "y=keep", the y offset from the center. Default: y=0.
#  - "o=(0|90|180|270|keep)", the screen orientation, degrees anticlockwise. Default: o=keep.
# One of the following:
#  - "keep" to keep the firmware logo. Also keeps coordinates by default.
#  - "remove" to remove the BGRT. Makes x and y meaningless.
#  - "black" to use only a black image. Makes x and y meaningless.
#  - "path=file.bmp" to read an image file.
#    * NOTE: The installer can copy and convert BMP, PNG, JPEG, GIF.
# Examples:
#  - image=remove
#  - image=black
#  - image= x=0 y=-200 path=topimage.bmp
#  - image= n=1 o=90 path=sideways.bmp
#  - image= n=50 y=999999 o=keep path=probable.bmp
# The above examples together would produce
#  - 1/54 chance for the default OS logo
#  - 1/54 chance for black screen
#  - 1/54 chance for topimage.bmp, 200 px above the center of the screen
#  - 1/54 chance for splash.bmp, centered, orientation set to 90 degrees
#  - 50/54 chance for probable.bmp, at the bottom edge, explicitly default orientation
# Default: just one image.
image= y=-200 path=splash.bmp
