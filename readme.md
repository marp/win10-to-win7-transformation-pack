# Windows 10 to Windows 7 Transformation Pack

This transformation pack contains code made by many different people, check credits for details.

This version is not yet tested. Should work Windows 10 22H2.

### Installation
1. Install everything from each folder, order is not important.
2. Copy Windhawk\ResourceRedirect to C:\Windows\ResourceRedirect
3. Copy Themes\ to C:\Windows\Resources\Themes
4. (Optional) Install Win7 Games & Apps
5. Done!

#### Note

Please know that HackBGRT is UEFI-only and you must *disable Secure Boot* in your BIOS setup! Otherwise, it will not work.

You can easily access BIOS setup by doing this (would be recommended to print this out or remember it yourself):
Go to the start menu, hold left shift key and restart. Go to advanced settings and look for an UEFI firmware option. Click on it.
Don't be scared of what it shows. If you have a BIOS password, enter it. Go to the boot tab (or something similar) and disable Secure Boot. Save settings and exit.
It should restart the computer. Now you can use HackBGRT! It is *still advised* you use it with caution, as it can brick your Windows installation.
