# ![Windows 7 Logo](Windows.png) Windows 10 to Windows 7 Transformation Pack 

This transformation pack is designed using the best available tools and resources to closely replicate the look and feel of Windows 7. Unlike many other packs, it is highly customizable and fully open-source.

**Warning:** This pack is still in active development.
The author is not responsible for any issues or data loss caused by using this pack. Please make sure to create a full backup before installation or use.

## Requirements
- Windows 10 version 22H2 (earlier versions have not been tested, but may work)
- You must configure PowerShell to allow script execution. Run PowerShell as an Administrator and execute the following command:
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    ```
- To use Explorer7 and Windhawk, you‚Äôll need a Windows 7 ISO or DVD that matches the type and language of your current system. Currently, only the en-US version is supported..

##### Control Panel Restoration 4.0 H1 Automatic Setup
I've created a PowerShell script that makes the installation of the control panel much easier. It's still not complete, so please go through each step carefully and read every README file.

You can select which control panel pages you want to apply: 
- Backup and Restore - `BackupAndRestore.ps1`
- Biometric Devices - `BiometricDevices.ps1`
- Display - `Display.ps1`
- Game Controllers - `GameControllers.ps1`
- Genuine Center - `GenuineCenter.ps1`
- HomeGroups - `HomeGroups.ps1`
- Language - **TODO - DUMMY** `Language.ps1`
- Mobility Center - **TODO**
- Network and Sharing Center - **TODO**
- Network Map  - **TODO**
- Notification Tray Icons  - `NotificationTrayIcons.ps1`
- Parental Controls-Family Safety - `ParentalControls-FamilySafety.ps1`
- Performance Information and Tools - `PerformanceInformationAndTools.ps1`
- Personalization - **CAN'T BE DONE** IMPORTANT README
- ~~Printers - redundant Vista style page `Printers.ps1`~~

#### Windows 7 Logo Branding
Run `Branding\copy.ps1`


#### HackBGRT

Please know that HackBGRT is UEFI-only and you must *disable Secure Boot* in your BIOS setup! Otherwise, it will not work.

You can easily access BIOS setup by doing this (would be recommended to print this out or remember it yourself):
Go to the start menu, hold left shift key and restart. Go to advanced settings and look for an UEFI firmware option. Click on it.
Don't be scared of what it shows. If you have a BIOS password, enter it. Go to the boot tab (or something similar) and disable Secure Boot. Save settings and exit.
It should restart the computer. Now you can use HackBGRT! It is *still advised* you use it with caution, as it can brick your Windows installation.

## üéØ Roadmap & Work in Progress
### ‚è≥ Planned Features
- Automated Setup Script - A unified PowerShell-based installer that can guide users step-by-step through the installation and configuration process.
- Localized Language Support - Currently only en-US is supported. Support for additional languages (e.g. pl-PL, de-DE, etc.) is planned.
- Improved Personalization Options - More pre-configured themes and color schemes resembling Windows 7 Aero styles.

### üîß Currently in Development
- **Control Panel Restoration 4.0 H1 Automatic Setup** - Work is in progress on a unified PowerShell script to simplify the installation of legacy Control Panel pages. The goal is to allow users to select desired modules and apply them with minimal manual steps. Some .ps1 scripts are functional, while others are still in development, marked as TODO, DUMMY, or IN PROGRESS in the respective file headers. Please read all accompanying README files carefully before use.
