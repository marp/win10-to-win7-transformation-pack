#### Windhawk
Just install this wonderful tool, it will be neccessary in next steps. Use `Windhawk\installWindhawk.ps1` for silent install.

To change icons look, install `Resource Redirect` mod for Windhawk. Copy resources with `Windhawk\copyResources.ps1` and set theme path to `C:\Windows\ResourceRedirect\theme.ini`
For taskbar install Explorer7


#### Logon screen
Install `AuthUX v0.0.1-beta\AuthUX-setup-x64.exe`

##### Control Panel Restoration 4.0 H1 Automatic Setup
I've created a PowerShell script that makes the installation of the control panel much easier. It's still not complete, so please go through each step carefully and read every README file.

You can select which control panel pages you want to apply: 
- Backup and Restore - `BackupAndRestore.ps1`
- Biometric Devices - `BiometricDevices.ps1`
- Display - `Display.ps1`
- Game Controllers - `GameControllers.ps1`
- Genuine Center - **IN PROGRESS**
- HomeGroups - `HomeGroups.ps1`
- Language - **TODO - DUMMY** `Language.ps1`
- Mobility Center - **TODO**

#### Windows 7 Logo Branding
Run `Branding\copy.ps1`


#### HackBGRT

Please know that HackBGRT is UEFI-only and you must *disable Secure Boot* in your BIOS setup! Otherwise, it will not work.

You can easily access BIOS setup by doing this (would be recommended to print this out or remember it yourself):
Go to the start menu, hold left shift key and restart. Go to advanced settings and look for an UEFI firmware option. Click on it.
Don't be scared of what it shows. If you have a BIOS password, enter it. Go to the boot tab (or something similar) and disable Secure Boot. Save settings and exit.
It should restart the computer. Now you can use HackBGRT! It is *still advised* you use it with caution, as it can brick your Windows installation.

## üéØ Roadmap & Work in Progress
### ‚è≥ Planned Features
- Automated Setup Script - A unified PowerShell-based installer that can guide users step-by-step through the installation and configuration process.
- Localized Language Support - Currently only en-US is supported. Support for additional languages (e.g. pl-PL, de-DE, etc.) is planned.
- Improved Personalization Options - More pre-configured themes and color schemes resembling Windows 7 Aero styles.

### üîß Currently in Development
- **Control Panel Restoration 4.0 H1 Automatic Setup** - Work is in progress on a unified PowerShell script to simplify the installation of legacy Control Panel pages. The goal is to allow users to select desired modules and apply them with minimal manual steps. Some .ps1 scripts are functional, while others are still in development, marked as TODO, DUMMY, or IN PROGRESS in the respective file headers. Please read all accompanying README files carefully before use.
